    "#### 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "**Ans:** `def` statement is used to create a normal function. where as `lamba` expressions are used to create `Anonymous functions`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference is that  the body of a lambda can consist of only a single expression, the result of which is returned from the function created and  a lambda expression is an expression which evaluates to a function object, while a def statement has no value, and creates a function object and binds it to a name. \n",
    "\n",
    "lambda functions can't be pickled because they have no (unique) name associated with them.Also, it might be worth pointing out that lambda is an expression whereas def is a statement. Since lambda is an expression, it can only contain other expressions .\n",
    "\n",
    "lambdas can also be used as expressions, where traditional functions cannot; but I think you knew this already"

    "#### 2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "**Ans:** The following are some of the benefits of lambda expressions: \n",
    "1. Can be used to create Nameless/Anonymous functions inside some complex functions if we are planning to use it only once.\n",
    "2. Moderate to small functions can be created in a single line\n",
    "3. Fuctions created using lambda expressions can be assigned to a variable and can be used by simply calling the variable"

    "#### 3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "**Ans:** The differences between map, filter and reduce are: \n",
    "1. `map()`: The map() function is a type of higher-order. This function takes another function as a parameter along with a sequence of iterables and returns an output after applying the function to each iterable present in the sequence.the syntex is  map(function, iterable(s))\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `filter()`: The filter() function is used to create an output list consisting of values for which the function returns true.the syntex is filter(function, iterable(s))\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `reduce()`: The reduce() function, as the name describes, applies a given function to the iterables and returns a single value The syntax is: reduce(function, sequence[, initial])\n"

    "#### 4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "**Ans:** Function annotations are completely optional both for parameters and return value. Function annotations provide a way of associating various parts of a function with arbitrary python expressions at compile time. \n",
    "Annotations of simple parameters `def func(x: expression, y: expression = 20):`  \n",

    "2. avoid using or limited use of global variables\n",
    "3. Proper Identation to increase the code readability\n",

    "5. Avoid using digits while choosing a variable name\n",
    "6. try to use a name for the function which conveys the purpose of the function\n",
    "7. Local variables should be named using camelCase format `(ex: localVariable)` whereas Global variables names should be using PascalCase `(ex:GlobalVariable)`. \n",
    "8. Constant should be represented in allcaps `(ex:CONSTANT)`."
