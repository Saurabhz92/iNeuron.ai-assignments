    "#### 1.To what does a relative path refer ?\n",
    "**Ans:** The relative path is the path to show path file with respect to your current working directory (PWD).  \n",
    "**For example:** if Absolute path to a file called s.txt is: `C:/users/admin/docs/s.txt` If my PWD is `C:/users/admin/` , then the relative path to `stuff.txt` would be: `docs/s.txt`       \n",
    "**Note:** PWD + relative path = absolute path"

    "**Ans:** A file can be open in python by using `open()` function. open function takes two arguments filename and mode of operation (optional). if mode is not provided the default mode of opening is read mode **`open(filename, mode)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`‘r’`** – Read Mode: This is the default mode for open(). The file is opened and a pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file’s content.\n",

    "* **`‘r+’`** – Read/Write Mode: Use this mode if you need to simultaneously read and write to a file.\n",
    "* **`‘a’`** – Append Mode: With this mode the user can append the data without overwriting any already existing data in the file. \n",
    "* **`‘a+’`** – Append and Read Mode: In this mode you can read and append the data without overwriting the original file.\n",
    "* **`‘x’`** – Exclusive Creating Mode: This mode is for the sole purpose of creating new files. Use this mode if you know the file to be written doesn’t exist beforehand."

    "**Ans:** The main difference is that **`read()`** will read the whole file at once ..this will read whole file by one by one words if we pass the number then itreation will happen .it would treat each character in the file separately, meaning that the iteration would happen for every character.\n",
