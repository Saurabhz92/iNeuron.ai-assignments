    "#### Q1. What is the difference between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__`?\n",
    "**Ans:**  **`__getattribute__`** is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an **AttributeError** of it fails to find an attribute of a class. **`__getattr__`** is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by  **`__getattribute__`**, but for this **`__getattribute__`** and **`__getattr__`** both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, **`__getattr__`** returns a default value.**` __getattr__`** is only invoked if the attribute wasn't found the usual ways. It's good for implementing a fallback for missing attributes, and is probably the one of two you want. So key difference is that **`__getattr__`** is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class. "

    "#### Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "**Ans:** The differences between Properties and Descriptors is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:** With Properties we can bind getter, setter and delete functions together with an attribute name, using the built-in property function or `@property` decorator. When we do this, each reference to an attribute looks like simple, direct access, but involes the appropriate function of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Descriptor:** Python descriptors are created to manage the attributes of different classes which use the object as reference. In descriptors we used three different methods that are __getters__(), __setters__(), and __delete__(). If any of those methods are defined for an object, it can be termed as a descriptor. Normally, Python uses methods like getters and setters to adjust the values on attributes without any special processing. Itâ€™s just a basic storage system. Sometimes, You might need to validate the values that are being assigned to a value. A descriptor is a mechanism behind properties, methods, static methods, class methods, and super()."

    "\n",

    "**Descriptor:** With Descriptor we can bind getter, setter and delete functions into a seperate class. we then assign an object of this class to the attribute name in our main class. When we do this, each reference to an attribute looks like simple, direct access but invokes an appropriate function of descriptor object."
