    "#### Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "**Ans:** In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. \n",
    "It comes up with the following advantages:\n",
    "- It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects\n",
    "- Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
    "- Multiple instances of an object can be made."

    "#### Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "**Ans:** Python searches for an attribute in an upward tree of attributes. it first searches for the attribute in its instance and then looks in the class it is generated from, to all super classes listed in its class header"

    "#### Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    "**Ans:** Python Classes usually have three types of methods which are Instance Methods (object level methods),Class Methods (class level methods),Static Methods (general utility methods)\n",
    "- **`self`** is the first argument for instance methods. which refers to the object itself\n",
    "- **`cls`** is the first argument for class methods which refers to the class itself"

    "#### Q5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    "**Ans:** **`__init__`** function is called every time an object is created from a class. The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose. It is only used within classes."

    "#### Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "**Ans:** To create a class instance, we need to call the class by its name and pass the arguments to the class, which its **`init`** method accepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** **`my_name = my_class(\"Mano\",\"vishnu\")`** Here `my_name` is an instance of class `my_class` with attributes \"Mano\" and \"Vishnu\"."

    "\n",
    "**Example:** **`class Car:`**  ➞  this creates a class called Car"
