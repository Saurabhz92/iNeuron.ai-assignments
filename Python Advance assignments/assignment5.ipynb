    "#### Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "**Ans:** When a class is derived from more than one base class it is called **`Multiple Inheritance`**. The derived class inherits all the features of the base case."

    "**Ans:** Delegation provides a proxy object for any class thay you want on top of the main class. its like a wrapper to your class so that you can access limited resources of the main class. we use a main function in parent class as a inheritance in child class so reuseability is happening .Simply Delegation means that you can include a instance of another class as an instance variable, and forward messages to the instance."

    "**Ans:** Composition is a concept that models a has a relationship. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types. This means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component . This relationship means that a Composite has a Component .\n",
    "In the concept of Composition, a class refers to one or more other classes by using instances of those classes as a instance variable. irrespective of inheritence in this approach all the parent class members are not inherited into child class, but only required methods from a class are used by using class instances."

    "**Ans:** A bound method is the one which is dependent on the instance of the class as the first argument. It passes the instance as the first argument which is used to access the variables and functions. A bound method is one that has **`self`** as its first argument. Since these are dependent on the instance of classes, these are also known as **instance methods**."

    "#### Q5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "**Ans:** Pseudoprivate attributes are also useful in larger frameworks or tools, both to avoid introducing new method names that might accidentally hide definitions elsewhere in the class tree and to reduce the chance of internal methods being replaced by names defined lower in the tree. If a method is intended for use only within a class that may be mixed into other classes, the double underscore prefix ensures that the method won't interfere with other names in the tree, especially in multiple-inheritance scenarios\n",

    "Pseudoprivate names also prevent subclasses from accidentally redefining the internal method's names,"
