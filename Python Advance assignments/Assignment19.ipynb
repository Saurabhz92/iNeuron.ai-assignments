    "#### Q1. Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many partnership, for example?\n",
    "**Ans:** Relationship between a class and its instances is a one to many partnership.A class is a blueprint which you use to create objects. An object is an instance of a class - it's a concrete 'thing' that you made using a specific class. So, 'object' and 'instance' are the same thing, but the word 'instance' indicates the relationship of an object to its class"

    "**Ans:**  . Methods are associated with the objects of the class they belong to. Functions are not associated with any object. We can invoke a function just by its name. Functions operate on the data you pass to them as arguments.So,the object's state can be modified by its method.Function can't access the attributes of an instance of a class or can't modify the state of the object."

    "#### Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private"

    "Reflection method we often encounter the requirement that a method in the executing object, or a variable in the calling object, or a field of the object should be assigned, while the method name or field name can not be determined when encoding the code, and need to be input in the form of passing strings through parameters."
